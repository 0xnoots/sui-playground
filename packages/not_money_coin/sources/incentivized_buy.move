// The point of this module is reward people for buying a used-noot, rather than buying a new
// noot. Perhaps a noot can increase in value the more it is sold?
// Conversely, we could reduce the value of a noot as it is sold (i.e., it gets 'damaged')
// Maybe we could also change a noot's data when it's sold??? Like randomize it some?
